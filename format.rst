The custom geometry file is a set of geometry elements. Each geometry element
starts with its name and the name of the grpoup it belongs to. The names are
followed by the element's index in the grpoup. The element's name can coinside
to the name of the group.  The next line following the names and the index
contains the number of sections Ns and the number of points Np that is used to
describe the section. The next table contains Ns columns and 3*Np lines: the
first Np lines contains the x-coordinates of the points, the next Np lines --
y-coordinates and the last Np lines -- z-coordinates.
